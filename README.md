PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT BEFORE YOU BEGIN MARKING, IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO MARK FASTER BY DECREASING THE TIME YOU SPEND LOOKING AROUND THE CODE.

Go to the phase0 folder for phase0, I would recommend looking at progress_report.md first

Go to the phase1 folder for phase1, I would STRONGLY recommend starting with DesignDocument.md. It references all the
other documents.

Go to the phase2 folder for phase2. Start with [DESIGN_DOCUMENT.MD](phase2/DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md)
