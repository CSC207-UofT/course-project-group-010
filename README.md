# University Course Review System

This is a course review system for University Courses, kind of like RateMyProf with additional features.
Students and professors will be able to view courses, leave reviews/ratings, and chat in the comments section.

Go to the phase0 folder for phase0, I would recommend looking at progress_report.md first

Go to the phase1 folder for phase1, I would STRONGLY recommend starting with DesignDocument.md. It references all the
other documents.
