# Walkthrough

## The Scenario
The scenario will be broken into 2 parts.

(We will assume a student already has an account in our system, with an associated id)
- The student will login through the command line interface, passing their id as an argument
- The student will request to view a course page(that exists). The info about the course, along with the rating, will be displayed to them
- The student will leave a rating on the course page
- The program will process the rating and then re-display the info about the course, now with the updated rating.
