# Use of GitHub Features

We have used the following GitHub Features:

1. Issues

- We use the issues section to create tickets about our program.

2. Pull requests

- We use pull requests to let team members know about the changes we want to push to our main branch. The others will
  review, comment, and changes the pull request before merging into the main.


3. Actions

- We use the Actions feature to automate our program workflows. For example, we added tests for some methods ( getSize,
  getComment) to automate the testing process.

4. Test Coverage

- We use the IntelliJ feature to check our test coverage. This helps to ensure a sufficient number of methods have been
tested and work properly.
