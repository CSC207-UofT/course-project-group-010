# Project Accessibility Report

For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program
adhere to that principle.

## Principle 1: Equitable Use

Features our program has: do not have it now.

Features planned to implement in the future:

1. the option of colour and brightness: this option will provide equitable use for the people with colour blindness and
   version issue.

## Principle 2: Flexibility in Use

Features our program has: do not have it now.

Features planned to implement in the future:

1.the option of the program: website, phone app, and desktop app. 2.the option of display: left or right-handed version.
3.the option of size: increase the size of display content.

4. the option of choosing to read or listen

## Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use

Features our program has: do not have it now.

1. provide effective prompting and feedback for users:
   -when the user logins, we provide the prompting to inform the user the correct combination of ID.(Prompting
   message: "Your ID is invalid. The ID must start with a letter. All subsequent characters can be letters or numbers.")
   -when the user enters his/her program detail, we provide the prompting to let the user choose.(Note : Choose from one
   of following options: ACCOUNTING, ACTUARIAL SCIENCE, ANTHROPOLOGY, APPLIED MATHEMATICS, APPLIED STATISTICS,COMPUTER
   SCIENCE, DATA SCIENCE. Or Entry N/A for Program Detail")

Features planned to implement in the future:

1. the option of common display languages: English, French, Mandarin, Japanese and Korean.

## Principle 4: Perceptible Information

Features our program has: do not have it now.

Features planned to implement in the future:

1. maximize "legibility" of essential information. -add the verification process before the rating or commend threads
   could be posted. For example, our rating range is from 0 to 5 and we prohibit the user to leave 0 as a rating. This
   verification process will reduce the chance of misleading information. Also, if the user leaves the commend threads,
   the program administrator will check the content of commend threads before posting it to the app.

## Principle 5: Tolerance for Error

Features our program has:

1. arrange elements to minimize errors:
   -when the user logins, they could enter either lower case or upper case of user type and program detail. The app will
   automatically convert them into upper case. -when the user types his/her IDs,the app will automatically remove the
   space of their input.
2. provide warnings of errors. -when the user logins, we provide the prompting to inform the user the correct
   combination of ID.(Prompting message: "Your ID is invalid. The ID must start with a letter. All subsequent characters
   can be letters or numbers.")

Features planned to implement in the future: do not plan future implementation.

## Principle 6: Low Physical Effort

Features our program has: do not have it now.

Features planned to implement in the future:
1.Minimize sustained physical effort:
-the option of size: increase the size of display content. This help reduce eye pressure. -the option of colour and
brightness: this option will provide equitable use for the people with colour blindness and version issue. This help
reduce eye pressure.

## Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

Features our program has: do not have it now.

Features planned to implement in the future: do not plan future implementation

This principle does not apply to this program because our program does not require the user to posture or move.

## Target users of our program if you were to sell or license your program to customers.

Our target users are the following:
-University Students who decide which course to take and who want to learn study tips -High Students who decide which
specialist they plan to apply to University -School and Prof who want to hear feedback from students to improve the
course.

## Less likely to be used by certain demographics

Our program is less likely to be used by kids and people who do not use a computer or smartphone.
