# Code Style and Documentation

We used the following features to review and edit our code style and documentation:

1. Reformat Code feature from Intellij (or shortcut ctrl+alt+l)

2. Inspect Code feature from Intellij --> we have few warnings now, with most of them being that we didn't document
when an exception gets thrown in the Javadoc

4. Code Cleanup feature from Intellij to clean up leftover/unwanted materials

5. Check each warning/red sign for each file

6. Review each class to see if the documentation is clear and easier to understand by outer

7. Change/Add the commentary for each constant using in the program
