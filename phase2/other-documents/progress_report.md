# Progress Report

## What has worked well so far with our design since phase 1



## Summary of what each group member has been working on since phase 1 + pull requests

- Kevin:  I code every day, so my pull requests are small but there's a lot of them. I implemented factory/strategy patterns for commands,
  wrote tests, and cleaned unused methods.
    - [adding factory/strategy patterns](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-group-010/commit/5ddf83715f61e20ca0d0ce7b3d8acb9a75f71406) ||
      [cleaning up unused methods](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-group-010/commit/7c19b3375be20919d07d09906550ca258a4611f4)
    - I looked through all the classes to delete unused methods by using the "find usages" intelliJ feature. I also implemented patterns in Command Classes, that used to
      do many different things. As a result, the design of our program follows SOLID principles better, and our classes are easier to understand without redundant methods.
- Fiona: I worked on implemented design patterns for users, wrote test cases, performed refactors and wrote the design document. 
    -[adding factory patterns to users](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-group-010/pull/89/commits/09d842dfb805c348b28775a32459dbdc8dc1f3a5)
      -I implemented factory patterns in Users by creating/modifying UserFactory, IUser, StudentUser, InstructorUser, and UserManager class.
