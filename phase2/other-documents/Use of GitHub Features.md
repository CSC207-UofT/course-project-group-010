# Use of GitHub Features

We have used the following GitHub Features:

1. Issues


- We use the issues section to create tickets about our program.


2. Pull requests

- We use pull requests to let team members know about the changes we want to push to our main branch. The others will
  review, comment, and changes the pull request before merging into the main.


3. Actions

- We use workflow actions to automate our JUnit tests whenever we push or merge request to main.
- Without triggering tests manually, we can check our codes run as how they are supposed to on github.

4. Test Coverage

- We use the IntelliJ feature to check our test coverage. This helps to ensure a sufficient number of methods have been
tested and work properly.
