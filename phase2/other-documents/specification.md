Our program is a course review system.

- Students and Instructors can login to the program
- We will have Course Pages, that can be viewed, rated and commented on.
- Users can rate the course, reply to comments or up/downvote comments.
- Relative rating: If the user specifies their program, we will show average ratings across different programs(eg. Overall rating=5.0, but Data science students rated a course 8.0)
- Users can view their own information
- You can create new users and courses(for debugging purposes)

Also, our program saves using the saveall command, which basically serializes a map of users/courses to a file.
