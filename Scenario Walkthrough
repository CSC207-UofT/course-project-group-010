Scenario Walk-Through

Scenario 1 : Rate the course
Kevin Hart, a student from University of Toronto, entries name (Kevin_Hart) and ID (12345) in order to log in to the
course review system to view the course information. Basing on his status as a student, the course review system assigns
the permission level (2) to Kevin. Then, Kevin entries the course code, CSC207H1, in the course directory.
This leads him to the course page which displays the course name, course code, course description, and course rate
as well as the current year and instructor name. This course page also provides the option for Kevin to leave a review
or rate the course. Kevin thinks CSC 207 course is pretty useful and decide to give it a rate of 8. The course review
system will take Kevinâ€™s input and recalculate the course rate.
